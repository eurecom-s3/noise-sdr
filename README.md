Electronic devices emit some unintended radio noise when working, this is usually known as Electro Magnetic (EM) noise (or EM leakage). This effect is well known for EM side channel attacks (or Tempest attacks) that exploit it to spy on the device, but also for building covert channels: a piece of code on the device controls the noise generated by the device to transmit information (Soft-Tempest). Such covert channels are limited in power and bandwidth, and, more importantly, they can transmit only on the frequencies where the leakage is present (e.g. harmonics of the clock). Existing covert channels are usually using simple modulations, for example, On Off Keying (make noise or not), to transmit information, which are simple to implement but also not very robust. With Noise-SDR we demonstrate that by controlling software running on the device, we can generate arbitrary modulations (using a technique known as RF-PWM). This allows to build more diverse and resilient transmitters and even allows to use protocols written for software defined radios, despite some limitations in power, frequency, and bandwidth.  We also demonstrate the possibility to transmit at longer distance and more reliably. Interestingly, the ability to transmit using existing protocols with a software defined approach opens the potential for applications other than covert channels, for example, trying to inject data in a victim receiver.

### Noise-SDR in a nutshell

Noise-SDR uses a leakage-based fully-digital software-defined approach to shape
electromagnetic noise produced by unprivileged software into generic radio
signals, arbitrarily modulated in amplitude/frequency/phase. Despite some limitations on
power, frequency and bandwidth, it can transmit data with a variety of analog
and digital radio protocols. 
Noise-SDR currently runs on x86_64 (Linux and Windows), ARMV7A/ARMV8A (Android),
and MIPS32 (OpenWrt). Please check the academic paper for more details.

***Note:*** This is just an initial release. You can already find the code and how to
(cross)compile it. Running fldigi-noise-sdr is straightforward (check the help menu).
We assume you have some familiarity with running code on various platforms,
EM leakage, popular SDR tools and radio protocols
(many resources online are available).

### Install

You can either install Noise-SDR manually or use Vagrant and Virtualbox to
automatically create a virtual machine. In either case, look at 
```noise-sdr/vagrant/Vagrantfile``` and ```noise-sdr/vagrant/boostrap.sh``` for
self-explaining installation instructions. Note that the actual Noise-SDR code
is only a small part of this, the rest being popular SDR tools required, for
example, for reception.
In addition, precompiled binaries for Noise-SDR are available [here][binary].

```
git clone https://github.com/eurecom-s3/noise-sdr.git
cd noise-sdr/vagrant
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

### Usage of fldigi/offline-noise-sdr

#### Transmit side

Once you have compiled Noise-SDR, run in on your machine, or push it to a phone
or other device to run it there (use the correct architecture).

```
fldigi-noise-sdr-XXXX --help
```

There is also an offline version of Noise-SDR.
In offline-noise-sdr you can find both a python script to generate RF-PWM timing
from IQ files
```
./rf-pwm.py generate --help
```
and a version of noise-sdr that reads these files
```
./offline-noise-sdr-XXXX --help
```

For Android you can use adb, e.g.,
```
adb push file /data/local/tmp # to push files to the device
adb shell
$ cd /data/local/tmp # to get a shell to run the programs
```
USB debugging has to be activated.
If device and laptop are on the same network you can connect without cable.

For the Carambola2, follow the guides:
[to build OpenWRT and connect to the board](http://www.8devices.com/wiki/carambola2),
[to install packages manually](https://pkg.8devices.com/carambola2/v2.9/packages/packages/), and
[to add an unprivileged user](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/security/secure.access#create_a_non-privileged_user_in_openwrt).
Cross-comilation is already covered here.

#### Receive side

Use your favorite tool for reception. For example, we use gqrx (and a USRP B210)
and Fldigi, using a virtual audio sink to connect them:
```
pulseaudio --start
pacmd load-module module-null-sink sink_name=MySink
```

Note that we provide example configuration files for FLDigi, GQRX, and WSJTX
in the folder ```configs```.

#### Replaying traces at the receive side

When using GQRX, you can save raw IQ samples and then replay it later.
Please check the GQRX documentations and tutorials for this.
FLDigi can also open and replay wav recordings.

You can find wav traces for the videos at the top of this page [here][traces]
in the sub-folder ```gqrx/videos-wav```.

You can find an IQ traces for the same examples as in the videos at the top of this page [here][traces]
in the sub-folder ```gqrx/videos-iq```.

#### Some more details for GNSS

We provide helper scripts and configurations in the ```gnss/``` folder.

For example, for GLONASS follow these steps.

1. Glonass with pre-recorded traces
    1. Download a GLONASS trace from [here][traces]. For example,
       ```glonass-innosd6000-2MSaps-800MHz-glonass-example.complex```
    2. Run the  reception script:
       ```./receive.sh glonass-innosd6000-2MSaps-800MHz-glonass-example.complex```
2. Record new traces
    1. Connect a suitable phone (e.g., Innos D6000, see paper) and make sure adb works.
    2. Enter in the glonass folder ```cd gnss/glonass/glonass-normal/```
    3. Run the script that generates an example of glonass signal, conversts it to rfpwm,
       and pushes it on the phone ```./generate-example.sh```
    4. Connect a USRP B210 radio to your laptop and run the ```rx.grc``` flowgraph.
       Adjust the parameters (e.g., harmonic you want to look at) in necessary.
    5. Run offline-noise-sdr on the phone giving the rfpwm file generated at step 3 as input.
    6. After a while, stop the flowgraph, which has generated the ```/tmp/glonass_rec``` IQ file.
    7. Run the reception script ```./receive.sh /tmp/glonass_rec```

Similar steps apply to the examples in ```glonass-slow-10```and ```gps```.

#### Some more details for LoRa

To receive LoRa packets we provide a modified version of gr-lora_sdr 
available at git@github.com:giocamurati/gr-lora_sdr-noise-sdr.git
(automatically installed in the vagrant VM).

Compared to the original version, we provide:
1. Two flowgraphs ```apps/lora_rx.grc``` and ```apps/lora_rx_simple.grc``` to scan the spectrum for
   packets sent by fldigi-noise-sdr using different modes.
2. An additional mode to receive LoRa-like packets without error correction, 
   that we used in the paper as baseline.
   
Like for the original version, remember to run ```source apps/setpaths.sh```
before running Gnuradio and opening the flowgraphs.

### Traces

You can find some pre-collected IQ traces [here][traces], and some pre-computed
RF-PWM files for offline-noise-sdr [here][rfpwm]. 
Precompiled binaries are [here][binary].
